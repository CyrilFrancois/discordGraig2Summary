Detailed Summary of the Heroes of Phandeline's Adventure

I – Reunion in Phandeline
The adventurers return to Phandeline after freeing the owl-bear from its berserk madness. At the entrance to the once-ruined village, a mixture of exhaustion and anguish grips them: the Bloodrock Forest, once vibrant with life, is now nothing but a landscape of coal and charred tree skeletons. Wenriem, the self-proclaimed mayor and descendant of the Silver Walls, holds council at Silver Wall Manor, now the center of reconstruction.

– Cellach, the thaumaturge with the silver shield, feels the weight of his broken promise to Venomous Fang, the green dragon, who demands the sacrifice of the druid guardian of the forest. – Lilie, the bard-thief, schemes behind her smiles to rally the people, while Irkul, hidden among the guards, observes the growing tension.

– Salazar, the naga druid: a nature-protecting druid who embraced the path of fire after unwittingly starting the blaze that burned the Bloodrock Forest, and now wields nature and fire spells.

– Ailouros, the mischievous cat-woman, weaves her way through the barracks to help the dwarven miners clear the old forge. The village is slowly returning to normal: dwarven miners and blacksmiths—Gundren, Ginder, Balmar, and Nundro Rockseeker—scrape the rock, while the dwarven artisans of Balmar's company develop inventions to fortify Phandeline. But beneath this facade of renewal, the ghosts of the fire linger: vengeful Dryads, banners of the Kalindra cult, and ancient hatreds threaten to erupt.

II – Smoldering Undergrounds and Natra's Rescue
Black smoke rises from the makeshift prison beneath the Rock-Hill tavern. Natra, the repentant paladin, imprisoned there, calls for help from the depths.

– Sildar, Irkul, and Ailouros descend into the storerooms, discovering utter chaos: ripped-open provisions, traces of goblins and kobolds, shattered armor.

– Natra senses a crumbling wall, smashes through it with a hammer blow, opening a three-meter chasm. The group, led by Salazar, who senses the living roots, descends into the nauseating darkness. – In the first dark chamber, a giant spider attacks: Cellach sets its webs ablaze, Salazar channels water from the roots to drown the beast. Victory.

– Further on, two galleries: one barricaded, the other leading to an octopus sanctuary. Goblins confer, a kobold plots. Furtive exchanges take place, Cellach attempts to parley, Natra clumsily crushes two goblins; a final one surrenders, spreading the rumor of a "Scaly Mistress" ruling deeper within.

III – Traps in the Courtroom
Guided by their prisoner, the heroes reach a vast courtroom controlled by an ancient mechanism: altars, statues of a great octopus, riddles involving weights and scales.

– After a risky bet on nine coins, it is Salazar who finds the foolproof method, unlocking a secret passage. – In the shadows, goblins and kobolds prepare an attack against Phandeline. Amidst interrogations, magical traps, and a pure water altar, Cellach intercepts Silver Wall's voice through his shield, giving instructions.

– A section of wall collapses, revealing a crypt where a necromancer and skeletons lie. A brief fight ensues: the undead are felled, a shield and a blue-flame torch are recovered, merging with Cellach's shield, from which he receives new whispers of his ancestors.

IV – Confrontation with the Scaled Mistress
A door gives way under Natra's blows: the kobold throne room opens, teeming with creatures.

– A trap with flashing spikes is triggered, but the group dodges it thanks to Ailouros's vigilance. – Outburst of violence: Natra and Cellach clear out the kobolds, Salazar summons a pillar of fire to terrorize the reptilian chieftain. Ailouros mercilessly slays the last beast.

– Before even cutting down the last of the lizards, a storm of ambushed arrows cuts down Cellach, who collapses, nearly dying under the kobold archers' attacks.

– Natra's desperate care, Salazar's miracle that revives his comrade-in-arms, but his condition remains critical. Galob, the surviving goblin, takes advantage of the chaos to steal some bread and escape; the heroes retreat, leaving behind the fallen queen and the mystery of a coordinated attack.

V – Truce at Phandeline
Exhausted, the heroes return to the surface:

– Cellach is taken to the village infirmary where Sister Garaëlle watches over him. – Natra distributes food and news to the people, seeking to build trust between humans, dwarves, and repentant goblins.

– Ailouros infiltrates the taverns to gather rumors and pickpocketing contracts, while Lillie allies herself with Irkul to organize surveillance of the alleyways.

– Salazar meditates in the forest, sensing the elemental disturbances.
