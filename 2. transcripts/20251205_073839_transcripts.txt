Lugh : Hello everyone. Today I'm testing a new automated pipeline for role-play game sessions. The
Lugh : goal is simple. Instead of taking manual notes during Discord sessions, we now record everything
Lugh : with the Craig bot. After the session, Craig gives us a multi-track audio file. First script
Lugh : in the pipeline called Audio Tutorune Script takes Craig's audio tracks, synchronize them
Lugh : and produce a complete transcript of everything that was said. The second script, don't script
Lugh : to summary, use that transcript and combine it with our game's context and the summary
Lugh : of previous sessions. With the help of charge-gbt, it generates a clean narrative summary of the
Lugh : adventure. This test audio is meant to verify that the transcription works correctly and
Lugh : that the full pipeline produces a current summary. Have a nice game.
