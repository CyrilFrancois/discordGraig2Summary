# Craig RPG Audio Transcriber & Story Summarizer

This project automates the way we archive and summarize our Discord roleplay sessions.
Originally, we relied on manual note-taking. Now, by using **Craig**, the Discord audio-recording bot, and a pair of Python scripts, we can automatically turn voice tracks into a full transcript and then into a readable story summary.

## Overview

After inviting Craig to your Discord server, you can download multi-track audio recordings of each session.
This project provides two scripts:

### 1. `audioToTranscript.py`

* Takes Craig’s downloaded ZIP file containing multiple audio tracks.
* Extracts each voice track and transcribes it locally (Whisper).
* Reconstructs the session chronologically.
* Produces a complete transcript file containing every spoken line.

### 2. `transcriptToSummary.py`

* Takes the raw transcript generated by the first script.
* Uses ChatGPT to convert it into a structured, readable summary.
* Integrates contextual worldbuilding and past events via reference files stored in `InfoGame/`.

These two steps allow you to automatically generate a running narration of your roleplay adventure.

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Craig bot audio recordings (ZIP format with multi-track AAC files)
* OpenAI API key (stored in `.env`)
* Whisper (local transcription)
* Standard Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

---

## How It Works

1. **Record the session** with Craig in Discord.
2. **Download the ZIP file** from Craig and place it into the `audio/` folder.
3. **Run `audioToTranscript.py`** to generate a complete transcript.
4. **Make sure `InfoGame/Context.txt` and `InfoGame/SummaryFromStory.txt` are up to date.**
5. **Run `transcriptToSummary.py`** to create a cleaned, concise summary of the session.
6. The final summary is stored in `summaries/`.

---

## Notes

* At least one previous summary must exist inside `summaries/` to maintain story continuity.
* The more detailed the context files are, the better the generated summaries.
* Transcription is fully local; only the summary generation requires the OpenAI API key.

## Purpose

This project provides an automated, reproducible way to:

* Save every spoken line from your RPG sessions,
* Maintain a chronological archive of transcripts,
* Build clear, narrative summaries of your adventure,
* Avoid manual note-taking and focus on roleplay.

Enjoy your automated storytelling workflow.
